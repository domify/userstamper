# Userstamper

## Overview

Userstamp extends `ActiveRecord::Base` to add automatic updating of `creator` and `updater` attributes.

Two class methods (`model_stamper` and `stampable`) are implemented in this gem. The `model_stamper`
method is used in models that are responsible for creating or updating other objects.
Typically this would be the `User` model of your application. The `stampable` method is used in 
models that are subject to being created or updated by stampers.

Gem was latest tested with Ruby 3.1.3 and Rails 7.0.3
In history the gem has been tested with Ruby 2.7.2, 2.7.3 and Rails 6.1.3.1.

## Features
to result in a `belongs_to` relation which looks like:

```ruby
  belongs_to :creator, class_name: '::User', foreign_key: :created_by
```

### Saving before validation
This includes changes to perform model stamping before validation. This allows models to
enforce the presence of stamp attributes:

```ruby
  validates :created_by, presence: true
  validates :updated_by, presence: true
```

Furthermore, the `creator` attribute is set only if the value is blank allowing for a manual
override.

## Usage
Assume that we are building a blog application, with User and Post objects. Add the following 
to the application's Gemfile:

```ruby
  gem 'userstamper'
```

Define an initializer in your Rails application to configure the gem:
config/initilialize/userstamper.rb:

```ruby
Userstamper.configure do |config|
  # config.default_stamper = 'User'
  # config.creator_attribute = :creator_id
  # config.updater_attribute = :updater_id
  config.deleter_attribute = nil
end
```

Ensure that each model has a set of columns for creators and updaters.

```ruby
  class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      create_table :users do |t|
        ...
        t.userstamps
      end
    end
  end

  class CreatePosts < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def change
      create_table :posts do |t|
        ...
        t.userstamps
      end
    end
  end
```

If you use `protect_from_forgery`, make sure the hooks are prepended:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception, prepend: true # with: anything will do, note `prepend: true`!
end
```

Declare the stamper on the User model:

```ruby
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    model_stamper
  end
```

If your stamper is called `User`, that's it; you're done.

## Customisation
The association which is created on each of the `creator_id` and `updater_id` can
be customised. Also, the stamper used by each class can also be customised. For this purpose, the
 `ActiveRecord::Base.stampable` method can be used:

```ruby
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    stampable
  end
```

The `stampable` method allows you to customize the `creator` and `updater` associations.
It also allows you to specify the name of the stamper for the class being declared. Any additional
arguments are passed to the `belongs_to` declaration.

## Upgrade
When upgradeing from activerecord_userstamp gem, please remove deleted attributes. 
Soft delete is not supported and not recommended. Soft delete is more pain in real life.

## Tests
Run

    $ bundle exec rspec
